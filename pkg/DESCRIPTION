Description: The Choice Modelling Centre (CMC) at the University
    of Leeds has developed flexible estimation code for choice
    models in R. The code uses the complete opposite of a
    black-box approach, i.e. the user sees every step in the
    coding of a log-likelihood function. We believe this to be
    essential in ensuring a greater understanding by users of
    the very powerful models they have at their disposal.
